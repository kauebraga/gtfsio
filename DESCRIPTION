Description: Tools for the development of packages related to General
    Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files. Establishes a standard for
    representing GTFS feeds using R data types. Provides fast and flexible
    functions to read and write GTFS feeds while sticking to this
    standard. Defines a basic 'gtfs' class which is meant to be extended
    by packages that depend on it. And offers utility functions that
    support checking the structure of GTFS objects.
